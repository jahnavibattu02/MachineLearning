# House Price Prediction with LinearRegression  

In this i'm going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. You'll use the dataset from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).   

We'll follow a step-by-step process to train our model: 
1. Download and explore the data
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Train a linear regression model
4. Make predictions and evaluate the model
