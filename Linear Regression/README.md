# House Price Prediction with LinearRegression  

In this i'm going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. You'll use the dataset from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).   


### Linear Regression for Solving Regression Problems

Linear regression is a commonly used technique for solving regression problems. In a linear regression model, the target is modeled as a linear combination (or weighted sum) of input features. The predictions from the model are evaluated using a loss function like the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


Here's a visual summary of how a linear regression model is structured:

To train a Linear Regression model, we can use the `LinearRegression` class from Scikit-learn. We covered the following Steps:

- Downloading a real-world dataset from Kaggle
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets
- Filling/imputing missing values in numeric columns
- Scaling numeric features to a $(0,1)$ range
- Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
- Training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluating a model using a validation set and test set
